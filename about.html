		<p> <h4> Nice to Meet You</h4>
		<div class="paragraph"> My name is Vivian, and I'm a junior at Cornell University's SC Johnson Business School. <p> I'm a thinker, doer and explorer -- with a hospitality background, business & finance experiences, and passion for impactful technology.<p> I believe successful and scalable technology means being empathetic to people's stories, staying cognizant of market and business conditions, and positively changing the community outside of its direct consumers.<p> I am currently looking for any Summer 2019 and Fall 2019 Intern oppurtunities.</div>

		<h4>My Tool Belt</h4>
		<div class="paragraph">
			From my <strong>Hospitality</strong> and service focused experiences in Cornell, at a luxury hotel and boutique jewelry shop, I learned the importance of managing relationships and delivering a lasting experience. <p>
			From my <strong>Finance</strong> experiences in banking and a college hedge fund organization, I gained skills of analyzing trends, markets, and assets. I learned the importance of managing resources and maintaining profitability.<p>
			Passionate to work with and help impactful <strong>Technology</strong> to spread, I have put myself in the shoes of a Product Designer, Data Scientist, and Product Manager to learn how a fully functional team works and am constantly searching for oppurtunities to learn about the business of creating, managing, and scaling technology.<p>

		<h4>You also can find me...</h4>
		<div class="paragraph">Travelling as a cultural and nature geek, meditating, skiing in Japan, singing, binge reading and creating new book lists, and binge watching supernatural dramas.</div>
